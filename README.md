# Wide Field Optical Mapping (WFOM) Utilities

This repository contains a myriad of code utilities I have used over the years during my PhD. Most tools are written in MATLAB, and currently are poorly maintained. I am slowly working on commenting and organizing this repository into something that may serve as a record of my analytical work during my PhD.

Dummy code example:

```
addpath(genpath('/local_mount/space/juno/1/Software/MIAO'))
m = makem;
path = findmousefolder('cm62_2','runF','2');
[m,data] = LoadData(path,m);
```
